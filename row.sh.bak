# If $cmd is empty, shell will try to execute $obj.
$cmd $obj

# This could be improved by adding a command line flag such as "-c"
# and then performing some sort of while loop and shift combination
# to capture the intended command after the $linenum variable is filled.
# There is a good example on
# http://www.shelldorado.com/goodcoding/cmdargs.html .
#
# There needs to be a way to append the remaining arguments to $cmd so that
# it behaves like
# !row 3 'ls -l'
